# Basic Baguette
This baguette is a good starting point for anyone looking to get into making them or wants a good base to work off when making something more exotic. This recipe does not utilize a [poolish](/gastronomy/methods/poolish), meaning that the flavor profile will not be as rich as other recipes, but this recipe is faster to make and harder for a beginner to mess up!

### Products
* 1 [baguette](/gastronomy/foods/baguette)

### Ingredients
* 1/3 cup [luke warm water](/gastronomy/drinks/water)
* 1 1/2 teaspoons (1 packet) [instant yeast](/gastronomy/ingredients/yeast)
* 1 cup [bread flour](/gastronomy/ingredients/flour-wheat)
* 2 teaspoons [kosher salt](/gastronomy/ingredients/salt) or 1 1/2 teaspoons [fine table salt](/gastronomy/ingredients/salt)

### Tools
* 1 large bowl
* 2 baking sheets
* 1 [silicone baking mat](/gastronomy/tools/silicone_baking_mat) or parchment paper

### Instructions
1. In a large bowl add the warm [water](/gastronomy/drinks/water) and [yeast](/gastronomy/ingredients/yeast).
2. Let the [water](/gastronomy/drinks/water) and [yeast](/gastronomy/ingredients/yeast) sit for 5 minutes to activate.
3. Add the flour and salt and mix briefly until a shaggy dough forms. Do not mix too much here.
4. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes
5. Knead the dough until smooth, adding _slightly_ more flour if needed.
6. You may grease the bowl and dough lightly to make removing easier.
7. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise for at least an hour and a half.
8. Fold the dough onto itself three times.
9. Cover the bowl again and let the dough rise for another hour and a half.
10. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface.
11. Roll out the dough into a baguette shaped log. The thinner you make it, the crunchier the whole thing will be.
12. Place the dough on a baking sheet with a [silicone baking mat](/gastronomy/tools/silicone_baking_mat) or parchment paper.
14. Cover the dough and let it rise one last time for an hour.
13. Preheat the oven to 450°F.
15. Slash the dough lengthwise and slightly diagonal with a razor or sharp knife.
16. Once the oven is at temperature, place a baking sheet with [water](/gastronomy/drinks/water) in the bottom rack.
17. Place the baking sheet with the dough in the next highest rack.
18. Bake for 15 minutes. Be sure to not open the oven, even though you really want to.
19. Open the oven and rotate the baking sheet 180° to bake evenly.
20. Close the oven and bake for another 15 minutes.
21. Remove the baguette and let it cool for at least 15 minutes, before devouring.

### Minor Variations
* Instead of using a second baking sheet with [water](/gastronomy/drinks/water), you can spray the [baguettes](/gastronomy/foods/baguette) with [warm water](/gastronomy/drinks/water) from a spray bottle.

### Takeaways
* We use [water](/gastronomy/drinks/water) in the baking process to produce a nice crispy crust.
* We make cuts in the dough in order to control the way our loaf will grow when baking.

### Pitfalls
* If you live an a high humidity area or it's just a very humid day, then [flour](/gastronomy/ingredients/flour-wheat) can absorb up to 10% extra [water](/gastronomy/drinks/water) from the air. If you find your dough too sticky to work with try adding _slightly_ more [flour](/gastronomy/ingredients/flour-wheat) to offset.
* No [poolish](/gastronomy/methods/poolish) means baguette snobs are going to scoff, so be sure to leave that out when describing your process to them!
