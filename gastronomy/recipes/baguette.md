# Crusty French Baguette

### Products
* 4 [baguettes](/gastronomy/foods/baguette) (about 60 1/2 inch slices)

### Ingredients
* 1.75 ounces warm water
* 1.5 teaspoons active dry yeast
* 16 ounces [bread flour](/gastronomy/foods/flour-wheat)
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 10 ounces cool water

### Tools
* A large bowl
* 2 baking sheets
* A silicone baking mat or parchment paper

### Instructions
1. In a small bowl, add the yeast to the warm water.
2. Add the flour into a large bowl and stir in the salt.
3. Stir in the activated yeast, after it has sat for a couple minutes.
4. Add the cool water, a little at a time, while stirring, just until a shaggy dough has formed (you may not need to use all of the water).
5. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface, and gently press it into a rectangle and fold into thirds.  Turn 90 degrees and repeat. 
6. Place the dough in a large oiled bowl, and cover with plastic wrap.  Allow it to rise in a warm place for 1 to 2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.
7. Divide the dough into 4 equal portions, and shape each one into a long loaf (about 15-inches long and 1 1/2-inches in diameter), with pointed ends.  
8. Place the loaves on a floured towel, cover with oiled plastic wrap, and allow to rise for 30 to 45 minutes.
9.  Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F, and place a pan of water on the bottom rack.
10. Uncover the baguettes and transfer to lightly greased baking sheets.
11. Sprinkle with flour, and make 4 elongated slashes down each one with a lame, razor, or sharp knife. 
12. Bake the breads for 35 to 40 minutes, or until crusty and brown.  (The baguettes should give a hollow sound when tapped.)
